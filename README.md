# Simpson's_Paradox
The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate one of  most interesting statistical phenomena in Statistics <br>
**The Simpson’s paradox**, named after a British statistician who first described it in 1951, is a statistical fallacy that occurs when aggregated groups of data show a particular trend, but that trend is reversed or eliminated when the data is de-aggregated (or, simply put, broken down). Understanding and identifying this paradox is extremely important for correctly interpreting data. Otherwise you’re left trying to take action on superficial data trends that don’t really translate into the real world.<br>
In this notebook I have demonstrated this phenomenon using a college admissions dataset<br>
`admission_data.csv` was used for this exercise. <br>
