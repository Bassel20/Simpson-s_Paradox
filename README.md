# Simpson-s_Paradox
this notebook was made to demonstrate one of  most interesting statistical phenomena in Statistics the Simpson's Paradox <br>
**The Simpson's paradox** refers to a phenomenon where a trend appears in several different groups of data, but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. It is a result of confounding variables, where the relationship between two variables is obscured by the influence of a third variable. This paradox can lead to incorrect conclusions and misleading results, which highlights the importance of considering all relevant variables when analyzing data. <br>
In this notebook I have demonstrated this phenomenon using a college admissions dataset<br>
`admission_data.csv` was used for this exercise. <br>
